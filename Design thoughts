Ideas from Inertia/Bridge:
	-Having a scenario agent to do demo control/management
	-Having a logger agent to do graphs output (including real-time forwarding to vis)
	-Build real-time graphs through websocket client in vis.js+eve.js
	-Startup agents from a mgmt agent, keeping pointers to the agents for bookkeeping
	-Using inheritence modeling to build a graph of agents.
	-Proxy agents to adapt to external domains.
